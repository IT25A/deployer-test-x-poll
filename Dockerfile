# SvelteKit app with a PostgreSQL database. Save as "Dockerfile" in the root of your repository.
#
# Before you use it, check:
#   - svelte.config.js uses "@sveltejs/adapter-node" (npm install -D @sveltejs/adapter-node)
#   - "npm run build" works on your computer and creates the folder "build"
#   - package-lock.json is committed to Git
#   - ".env.example" is committed and contains a value for every variable of src/env.ts (see README.md)
#   - the folders "scripts" (with migrate.js) and "migrations" exist (see README.md)
#   - "pg" is listed under "dependencies" (not "devDependencies"), because the migration script needs it

# Stage 1 "build": install everything, build the project, then remove the development tools again.

# after the migrations have worked, so the database is reachable. It also works when the start page
# redirects to the login. A route that checks the database is in README.md (then use fetch on "/health").
